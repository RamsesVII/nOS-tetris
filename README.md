### Developer journal.

First of all, when I started to develop NEO dapps, it was very hard to start make valueable things, because NEO API has difficult API.
When I heared about nOS, I quickly looked through the nOS documentation, and find it very simple and promise!

The first run was success, it was impressive! But after week, I was pulled fresh developer branch and some problems appears, but thanks to great community, a core members quickly help me, and  I was able to move on!

It was a trial attempt, to understand how powerful the nOS is. Now ahead of a serious application for automatic baggage tipping at airports through RFID tags! ðŸ™‚
